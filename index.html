  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="section textblock">
    <h1>Gentrification Dynamics in Berlin</h1>
    <p>Gentrification has been a much-discussed term in political discourse in major German cities for years. The term describes the process of urban upgrading of neighborhoods with an accompanying displacement of the resident population by groups of people with higher incomes. Surprisingly, there are hardly any data-based studies on the systematic analysis of the spatial patterns of gentrification processes, despite the great attention in politics, media and culture regarding the topic. The last such study for Berlin was conducted by Holm & Schulz (2016), in which the authors created an index to measure gentrification at district level, taking into account real estate development and social dynamics. The data analyzed dates from 2007 to 2014. Our work aims to build on this research, developing it methodologically and using more up-to-date data.</p>

    <p><strong><em>In which Berlin districts (LOR Prognoseräume) can the most significant gentrification dynamics be identified based on data from 2009 to 2020?</em></strong></p>

    <p>Building on the Gentriindex by Holm & Schulz, an analysis of spatial patterns of gentrification was carried out at the level of the LOR forecast areas on the basis of data from the Berlin Housing Atlas using a self-created index. Like the Gentriindex, our index uses proxy indicators to measure gentrification dynamics. In our model, the decline in the proportion of unemployed people within a study area, for example, does not stand for positive economic development in the neighborhood, but is an expression of displacement. Our index comprises the following 5 indicators, for each of which we have created our own sub-indices:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sub-index 1: Development of asking rents between the years 2009 - 2020 (35% weighting)</li>
      <li>Sub-index 2: Development of the proportion of SGB II dependents between 2009 and 2020 (35% weighting)</li>
      <li>Sub-index 3: Apartment sales between the years 2012 - 2017 & 2015 - 2020 (10% weighting)</li>
      <li>Sub-index 4: Conversions of rental apartments between the years 2012 - 2017 & 2015 - 2020</li>
      <li>Sub-index 5: Proportion of residents with at least 5 years of residence in 2020 (10% weighting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Zooming in on the smaller scale</h2>
    <p>In view of the fact that gentrification processes manifest themselves at the small-scale neighborhood level, it is not sufficient to look at the rough spatial distribution of gentrification dynamics across the city. For this reason, we took a closer look at the Prognoseraum with the highest value in the final index, Moabit. As there is no reliable open geodata on rental price trends at the small-scale level, we had to concentrate on analyzing data on social displacement. This led to the following question:</p>

<p><strong><em>“Are there specific neighborhoods(LOR Planungsräume) within Moabit that exhibit particularly high rates of social displacement,reflecting intensified gentrification dynamics at the micro level?”</em></strong></p>

<p>The results of three important social indicators (unemployment rate, proportion of transfer recipients and child poverty) are shown in the following maps.</p>

    <h2>Whats next?</h2>
    <p>This analysis of gentrification dynamics closes a research gap by further developing an existing index model for measuring gentrification and using more up-to-date data. It allows only limited conclusions to be drawn about the causes of gentrification, but provides a solid basis for identifying spatial patterns and justifying planning interventions at the neighborhood level.

    For the Moabit-Prognoseraum, for example, clearer social displacement dynamics can be seen for the eastern and southern Planungsräume. These small-scale differences can, among other things, provide information about the effects of individual construction projects such as Europacity, which was implemented in the Heidestrasse planning area during the study period.

    Our project offers the opportunity to conduct further research at the neighborhood level in order to reveal detailed spatial patterns of gentrification in other Prognoseräume in Berlin. The provision of open geodata on rental price developments at this planning level would be desirable for the future in order to increase the relevance of the results.</p>
